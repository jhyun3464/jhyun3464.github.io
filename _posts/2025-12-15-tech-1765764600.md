1. **Title**: CapROS: A Secure, Real-Time OS Redefining Persistence

2. **Summary**:
    *   CapROS is a novel operating system that merges traditional capability-based security with modern performance and resource management, resulting in a small, secure, real-time system with orthogonal persistence.
    *   It continues the legacy of the EROS project, acknowledging contributions from Jonathan Shapiro, and builds upon foundational ideas from systems like KeyKOS.
    *   The project is hosted on GitHub, operates under the GNU General Public License for redistribution, and holds copyrights by Strawberry Development Group and Charles Landau.

3. **Key Takeaway**: CapROS stands as a testament to evolving operating system design, leveraging a rich history of capability-based security to deliver a modern, reliable, and persistent computing environment.
