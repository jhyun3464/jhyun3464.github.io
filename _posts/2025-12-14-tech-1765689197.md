1.  **Title**: Fil-C and Linux Sandboxing: A Dual Security Deep Dive
2.  **Summary**:
    *   Memory safety (like Fil-C) and system sandboxing (using Linux tools such as seccomp) are distinct yet complementary security mechanisms that, when combined, offer the most robust defense.
    *   Integrating Fil-C with existing Linux sandboxes, exemplified by OpenSSH, necessitates specific adaptations: pre-initializing Fil-C's runtime threads via `zlock_runtime_threads()` before sandbox activation and minor adjustments to the seccomp filter to accommodate Fil-C's memory allocator and synchronization needs.
    *   Fil-C specifically enhances the `prctl` syscalls (`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, `PR_SET_SECCOMP`) by ensuring these critical security policies are uniformly applied across *all* its internal runtime threads, preventing potential sandbox bypasses.
3.  **Key Takeaway**: Fil-C's thoughtful design allows for seamless integration of memory safety with strict Linux sandboxing, intelligently managing its runtime threads and universally applying security policies to create a highly secure environment.
