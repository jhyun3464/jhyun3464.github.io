## Tips: Practical Info for Your Wanju Adventure

*   **Check Official Dates & Times:** As festival dates vary annually, always check the official Wanju-gun cultural or tourism website closer to your desired travel time for the most up-to-date schedule, admission fees (if any), and detailed program information.
*   **Getting There:** Wanju-gun is located in Jeonbuk-do. While the exact festival grounds might require local transportation, you can typically reach Wanju via intercity buses from major cities like Seoul. Consider renting a car for greater flexibility, especially if you plan to explore the surrounding area. The address, 89 Gosanhyuyangnim-ro, Gosan-myeon, Wanju-gun, is a good starting point for navigation apps.

*   **Accommodation:** While there might be guesthouses or pensions in Wanju-gun, you can also consider staying in the nearby bustling city of Jeonju (famous for its Hanok Village), which offers a wider range of accommodation options and is a short drive away.
