**Title**: Event Sourcing Markets: Exchanges and Distributed Order Logs

**Summary**:
*   Exchanges transform the dynamic, mutable state of an order book into an immutable, append-only sequence of discrete market events.
*   This process involves logging every order submission, modification, cancellation, and trade execution as distinct, time-stamped entries in a continuous stream.
*   Utilizing a distributed log enhances data integrity, auditability, system resilience, and allows for efficient real-time market data dissemination and historical state reconstruction.

**Key Takeaway**:
By treating every order book change as an event in a distributed log, exchanges establish a robust, scalable, and verifiable foundation for managing market data and operations.
