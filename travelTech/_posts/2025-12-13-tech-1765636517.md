**Title**: FractalBits: Unlocking Affordable High-Performance Object Storage for AI

**Summary**:
*   FractalBits addresses the "high-performance trap" in object storage, where existing solutions like S3 Express One Zone offer speed but are prohibitively expensive for modern AI and analytics workloads due to high per-request costs and poor small object economics.
*   It is designed to deliver high IOPS and native directory semantics (including atomic rename) at a significantly lower cost, offering performance comparable to S3 Express One Zone but with up to 150x cost reduction for intensive small object operations.
*   The core innovation is a metadata engine built on an on-disk radix tree (implemented in Zig) for efficient path-like keys, optimized for small object handling and directory operations, combined with a Rust-based S3-compatible API gateway and a Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployment model.

**Key Takeaway**: FractalBits aims to provide an economically viable high-performance object storage solution that combines the scalability of object stores with critical filesystem-like semantics, directly targeting the unmet needs of demanding AI and analytical workloads.
